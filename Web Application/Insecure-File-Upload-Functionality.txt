#Lack of Antivirus
The web application was identified to include a file upload functionality which did not conduct antivirus checks for files being uploaded. 
This meant that users may upload malicious files to the web application and potentially exploit users with the ability to download these files.
This may be standard web application users or backend administrators.
An antivirus solution should be implemented as part of the file upload functionality.

#Lack of Filetype Restriction 
The web application was identified to include a file upload functionality but did not restrict the type of file that can be uploaded. 
This meant that users may upload potentially malicious filetypes such as .exe, .bat, .html and more.
This may be used to exploit users with the ability to download these files or the web application itself.
Strict upload restrictions should be implimented as part of the file upload functionality. For example, only .PDF or .PNG files.
