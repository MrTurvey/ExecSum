The web application was susceptible to Cross Site Request Forgery attacks. 
This allows requests to be crafted by an attacker and sent to victims to conduct an action the attacker may not be sufficiently privileged to issue.
CSRF can be mitigated by sending a single-use random value with each HTTP request to enable the server to validate the request came from the legitimate user.
