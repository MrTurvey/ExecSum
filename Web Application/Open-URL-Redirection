A flaw on the web application was discovered whereby it was possible to craft a response to redirect a user to an arbitrary URL.
This vulnerability could be used to redirect a legitimate user to a malicious site where credentials or data could be stolen.
All user input should be validated. In this case, URLs that are not expected by the web application should be rejected.
This can be done using a whitelist approach of valid URLs.
