The token used for web authentication was found to be present in a URL. 
Using tokens within the URL carries a risk that the URL will be acidentally shared or stored by web caches. These could be accessed by attackers and subsequently used, leading to unauthorised account access.
Authentication tokens should not be passed in URLs and rather, should be passed as an Authorization header or session cookie.
