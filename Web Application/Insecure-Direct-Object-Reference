Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) occur when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input.
As a result of this, attackers can bypass authorisation and directly access resources stored on the underlying host system.
Authorisation checks must be conducted on all functionality that displays and manages data.
