The mobile application does not resist attempts to be installed on a jailbroken iOS device or rooted Android device. 
These devices can allow attackers to subvert process and filesystem protections in order to run applications or access data they normally would not be able.
This increases the likelihood that attacker's exploits will succeed when targeting the application.
Jailbreak and Root detection should be implimented into the mobile application.
