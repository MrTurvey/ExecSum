Mobile applications can use certificate pinning to ensure taht the application is protected against man-in-the-middle attacks when the application is running on a hacked device.
If the certificate presented by the remote servers do not match the certificate of the application, the application will refuse to make the network connection.
Certificate pinning should be implimented by the mobile application.
