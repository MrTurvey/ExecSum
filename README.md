# ExecSum 
## What is this project? 

ExecSum is a useful collection of executive summaries that can be used during security assessments. These include issue briefs for web applications, infrastructure, mobile, cloud and beyond. The idea is that when clients want periodic updates for any issues found during an assessment, this repo has you covered and saves you a lot of writing time.
