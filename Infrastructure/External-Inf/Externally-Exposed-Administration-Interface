Due to the level of access and control, administrative portals and services are natural targets for attackers. 
By making them publicly available encorages attacks such as brute force. 
Administrative interfaces should be restricted to whitelisted IP addresses or limit the availability to internal networks. 
In addition, where possible, consider implementing two-factor authentication.
