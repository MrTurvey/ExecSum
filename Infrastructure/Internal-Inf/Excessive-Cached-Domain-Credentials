Windows hosts can cache a defined number of crednetials to ensure users can connect to the host when a domain is not accessible.
In this case, the number of cached passwords was excessive and could mean that attackers acquire a large amount cached credentials on a compromised host.
This should be reduced to zero for servers which are always expected to be connected to the domain and two for laptops.
