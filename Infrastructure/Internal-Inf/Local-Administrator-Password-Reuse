A local administrator password was discovered to be reused across several hosts. This means their password hash is also reused.
Pass The Hash can then be conducted by authenticating to hosts using the NTLM hash, rather than a userâ€™s password. This is by design and is hard to mitigate.
As the Local Administrator account can perform many privileged tasks on a host, data can be stolen from the servers including dumping of the LSA secrets to gain user hashes, which can be cracked.
Passwords should never be reused and to help mitigate this, Microsofts Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) should be used.
