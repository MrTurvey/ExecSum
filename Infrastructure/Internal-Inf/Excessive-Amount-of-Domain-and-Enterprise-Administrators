The Windows domain was discovered to have a high number of user accounts belonging to the 'Domain Admins' security group.
This widens the attack surface for one of these many accounts to become compromised and thus, lead to domain compromise.
All domain membership groups should be reviewed to ensure that users only have access to the associated rights relevant to their business requirements.
