It was possible to exploit Windows lookup protocols LLMNR and NetBIOS. 
An attacker can listen and respond to network requests sent by these protocols and to pretend to be a server being queried.
The victim machine will send credentials in the form of a password hash to authenticate to the spoofed server. 
An attacker can then crack the given hash using password cracking software and thus gain access to the account.
The NetBios Name Service and LLMNR should be disabled.
